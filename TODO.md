### Ideas
- Singleplayer for sure!
- Make it online so you can play with friends with scoreboard at the end?
- Customizable? Like, only girl groups, only boygroups, only one gen, etc
- Share in social media your score?
- One daily game for everyone to compete?

### Types of games i want to add
- [ ] Guess the song by a little snippet
- [ ] Select a song from a random pack (6 maybe) that are assigned random points, try get the most
  - Maybe use some kind of rule to choose the value of each song/idols/etc (views, year, idk)
- [ ] Choose one of a pack of songs/idols/etc with one kind of rule
  - From x year to x
  - From a to z
  - Show a final recap with all the user chose
- [ ] Guess the idol by voice
- [ ] Higher or lower MVs views


### MVP
- [ ] Game select page
- [ ] Database to store idols, videos, etc (prisma, postgre)
- Gamess pages
  - [ ] Guess song/idol from snippet
  - [ ] Higher of lower MVs
  - [ ] Choose one of a pack of songs/idols/etc with one kind of rule
